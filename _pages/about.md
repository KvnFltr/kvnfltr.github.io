👨🏻‍💻 I’m an AI & Data Science engineering student at **ESIEE Paris**, studying **Physics** in parallel at **Sorbonne University**.

🔬 **Research & builder mindset.** I’m interested in **applied LLMs**, evaluation/robustness on user-generated data, **retrieval-augmented** systems, and the craft of turning messy real-world signals into reliable, shippable tools. I like small, testable repos, clean notebooks, and stress-tests that actually break things before users do.

📚 **Where to explore:** a few highlights live in my [**Portfolio**](/portfolio/) (short write-ups; deeper notes inside each entry). I keep longer technical notes private until they’re stable—quality over noise.

## Selected Experience

### 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional / Research Experience
**Independent student research.** Recently, I’ve been prototyping lightweight **RAG** pipelines and **evaluation harnesses** for noisy, multilingual text: prompt stress-tests, answer scoring with simple baselines vs LLM judges, and dataset slices for failure analysis. The goal is repeatability first, flash later.

**CNRS / ESYCOM Lab — Research Intern.** Worked on conditioning circuits for **triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG)**; modeled variants and validated **Bluetooth-powered** transmission on benches (LTSpice, scopes). Learned to be skeptical, measure twice, and share plots that speak.

**Product-oriented ML.** I enjoy shipping small end-to-end stacks (ingest → clean → analyze → surface) with a bias for reliability, UX clarity, and leaving room for ablations.

## 🧪 Projects (short teasers)
**UniSpace — Campus Room Booking.** Real-time availability, conflict checks, role-based access, and usage analytics.  
*Stack:* React/Tailwind (or Flutter), Firebase Auth/Firestore, Cloud Functions.  
*See more:* [Portfolio](/portfolio/)

**Chrome mini-extension — Smart Filetype Search.** A tiny helper to speed up finding **datasets / PDFs / slides** by composing advanced queries and remembering useful patterns. Minimal UI, gets out of the way.  
*See more:* [Portfolio](/portfolio/)

**Review-Intelligence notes.** I sometimes distill lessons learned from large-scale, multilingual feedback streams—how to structure themes, measure consistency, and avoid over-prompting. When stable, parts will graduate to the portfolio.

## 🤖 Open Source & Contributions
I like **re-implementing** small ideas and releasing **minimal, readable** baselines (k-NN/SVM, retrieval scaffolding, evaluation scripts). When I publish something, I aim for:
- a tiny, reproducible repo,
- a short README that explains *why* before *how*,
- results tables that make comparisons honest.

A few utilities from the projects above occasionally get open-sourced in trimmed-down form (indexers, prompt/eval runners). Links will appear in the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) as they harden.

## 📜 Re-implementing & Reproducing
I learn fastest by **reproducing**: lock a metric, define a small eval set, then iterate. I favor clarity (ablation tables, exact seeds) over breadth. If something beats a decent baseline, it earns its keep; otherwise it’s a note, not a feature.

---

## Teaching
Starting **November**, I’ll be **tutoring Mathematics** (fundamentals & problem-solving). I like designing short sequences with tight feedback loops, so learners see progress weekly rather than eventually.

---

## Involvement
**Secretary-General — Jeunes Français de l’Étranger (JFDE).** National youth representation for French expatriates: initiatives, partnerships, and pragmatic support so projects actually move.

---

## Elsewhere
I co-founded **[reaply.ai](https://reaply.ai)** — a practical take on turning customer reviews into structured signals and **useful operations**. I keep it light here; if you’re curious about the product angle, you’ll find pointers inside the [Portfolio](/portfolio/).
