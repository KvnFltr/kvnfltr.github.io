🎓 I study **AI & Data Science** at **ESIEE Paris** and **Physics** at **Sorbonne University** (parallel track).

👀 I’m interested in **applied machine learning**, careful evaluation, and building small, usable systems from real data.

🚀 I co-founded an **AI review-intelligence SaaS**: **[reaply.ai](https://reaply.ai)**

## Selected Experience

### 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional / Research Experience

Since **April 2024**, I have been a Co-Founder at **[Reaply](https://reaply.ai)**, building applied AI for review intelligence. I work on the data pipeline that processes **10k+ reviews/day** across **200+ locations** (collection, cleaning, cloud storage with Python) and on the analytics layer—multilingual auto-replies and key insights (themes, sentiment, intent) via external integrations. *Paris, Apr 2024–present.*

I previously interned at the **CNRS / ESYCOM Laboratory**. My work was to **simulate and test a conditioning circuit for a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)** to harvest energy and **power a Bluetooth transmission to a smartphone**. The study was inspired by the Nature paper *“Employing a MEMS plasma switch for conditioning high-voltage kinetic energy harvesters”*.

For **four years**, I ran **MyStyle Media Agency**, a social-media analytics venture that evaluated Instagram accounts with quantitative methods to select creators for brand campaigns; I also operated a **140k-follower** channel.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
Starting **November**, I will **tutor mathematics** for first- and second-year undergraduate students (algebra and calculus). I prepare targeted exercise sets, work through exam-style problems, and provide brief written feedback after each session.

I am the **Secretary-General of Jeunes Français de l’Étranger (JFDE)**. JFDE is a national youth association that represents and supports young French expatriates through advocacy, community programs, and networking.
