üëã **Hi, I‚Äôm K√©vin.** I‚Äôm an AI & Data Science engineering student at **ESIEE Paris (DSIA)** and studying **Physics at Sorbonne** in parallel. I co-founded **Reaply**, an AI platform turning multi-site customer reviews into **actionable operations** (collection ‚Üí analytics ‚Üí benchmarking ‚Üí auto-reply).

---

## Highlights
- Built LLM-powered review analytics & **auto-reply** workflows for **200+ locations** (themes, sentiment, intent, prioritization).
- Shipped dashboards for **network-level benchmarking** (per brand/site, time, topic) and CSV/BI exports.
- Led projects from data pipelines to product delivery (**Python, Firebase, React/Tailwind**, APIs).

---

## Selected Projects
**Reaply ‚Äî Review Intelligence for Multi-Site Brands**  
Insights & ops from large-scale reviews: collection, multilingual NLP (themes/sentiment/intent), alerts, **benchmark vs competitors**, and auto-responses.  
*Role:* co-founder, data & product.  
*Stack:* Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, LangChain/LLMs, React, GCP/Firebase.

**UniSpace ‚Äî Campus Room Booking**  
Self-serve room reservations with real-time conflict checks, SSO, and analytics.  
*Role:* full-stack (logic, auth, security rules, UI/UX).  
*Stack:* React/Tailwind (or Flutter), Firebase (Auth/Firestore), Cloud Functions.  
_Award:_ **Coup de C≈ìur** @ ESIEE ‚ÄúJour des Projets‚Äù.

**Face-Recognition Pipeline**  
End-to-end pipeline (detection ‚Üí alignment ‚Üí embedding ‚Üí classification) with rigorous evaluation.  
*Stack:* Python, OpenCV, scikit-learn / TensorFlow.
