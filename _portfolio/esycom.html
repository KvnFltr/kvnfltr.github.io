Four-week research internship at the **CNRS / ESYCOM Laboratory** *(26/06/2023–21/07/2023)*.  
**Goal:** simulate and validate a **conditioning circuit** for a **Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG)** that harvests mechanical energy (vehicle pass) and **powers a Bluetooth transmission** to a smartphone.

**Reference:** Nature Communications — *“Employing a MEMS plasma switch for conditioning high-voltage kinetic energy harvesters”*.

### Context & Objective
TENG devices deliver **high-voltage, low-current, pulsed** outputs—not directly usable by electronics. The project adapts the two-stage chain from the paper—**Bennet doubler → hysteresis switch → step-down DC-DC → regulator**—to store energy and supply **~3.3–3.6 V** for a Bluetooth node.  
My task was to **compare circuit options**, **model** them in **LTSpice**, and **verify** behaviors on a **bench prototype** and **on-site tests**.

### Approach
1. **Modeling.** I implemented the full path in LTSpice with parametric sweeps for:
   - Bennet doubler capacitors/diodes (charging efficiency);  
   - Hysteresis thresholds (switching stability and charge bursts);  
   - Storage capacitance & DC-DC parameters (ripple vs. time-to-start).  
2. **Measurement.** I assembled a prototype, captured **node voltages** (M, N, P, Q) with an oscilloscope, and logged cycles.  
3. **Field test.** I validated energy input with a **vehicle pass** on the ramp device; mechanical alignment and surface friction were tuned for repeatability.

### Selected results
- **Node N charging:** the doubler accumulates charge with the expected sawtooth growth; the **hysteresis** provides clean, bursty discharges that accelerate storage.
- **Regulated output:** **Q** rises to a **stable ~3.3 V**, sufficient to boot the Bluetooth node; storage sizing trades start-up time vs. stability.
- **Practical insights:** mechanical coupling dominates real-world variance. Small changes in ramp pressure/positioning significantly impact available energy—guardbands are necessary.

### What I did
- **LTSpice modeling & parameter sweeps** (Bennet, switching thresholds, storage dimensioning).  
- **Bench measurements & comparison** to simulation; consolidation into **operating windows** (component values that consistently meet the 3.3 V target).  
- **Recommendations** for next iterations: improved mechanical fixture for the ramp, diode selection for lower forward drop, and a soft-start strategy on the DC-DC stage.
